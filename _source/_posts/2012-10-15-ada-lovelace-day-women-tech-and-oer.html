<p>Ada Lovelace&#160;&#8212; widely considered the first computer programmer&#160;&#8212; <a href="http://cssu-bg.org/WomenInCS/ada_lovelace.php">famously said</a>, &#8220;I never am really satisfied that I understand anything; because, understand it well as I may, my comprehension can only be an infinitesimal fraction of all I want to understand.&#8221; That quotation brings to mind the axiom that a curious mind is always asking more questions and learning is never complete. Every day, like Lovelace, I am all too aware that my knowledge is dwarfed by what I have yet to learn.</p>
<p>Around the world today, the technology community is <a href="http://findingada.com/">celebrating Lovelace and the many women in technology who&#8217;ve followed in her footsteps</a>. Here at Creative Commons, we think a lot about women in science and technology and the untapped potential we have yet to realize. In his speech to the United Nations a few weeks ago, President Obama spoke of the importance of women and girls in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/24/fact-sheet-equal-futures-partnership-expand-women-s-political-and-econom">The White House identified Creative Commons</a> as a key member of an emerging community of practice supporting girls in STEM.</p>
<p>A few days later, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34311">Creative Commons and the OpenCourseWare Consortium announced</a> that we&#8217;d formed a task force to determine how open educational resources (OER) can support the success of girls and women in STEM fields. As I said in that announcement, the challenges of the future will require bright, ambitious, well-educated people of both genders.</p>
<p>Many people reading this probably know that the OER movement played a pivotal role in my career. When I was at the Hewlett Foundation, we made a gamble in starting our <a href="http://www.hewlett.org/programs/education-program/open-educational-resources">OER initiative</a>. At that time, OER was an untested idea. Today, those early investments are paying off, with open-licensed resources benefitting women, men, boys, and girls around the world, many of whom wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have access to high-quality educational materials that can be localized and improved for teaching and learning.</p>
<p>But like Lovelace, we&#8217;re not yet satisfied. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34288">Last month&#8217;s groundbreaking open textbook legislation in California</a> was a huge step in the right direction, but it was just one step. We must keep the end vision in mind: together, we can democratize education through openly licenses resources, tools and processes. While we can&#8217;t create future Ada Lovelaces in a lab, we can provide for a culture of education that rises to the challenge of its most curious learners.</p>
