<p><a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/">Geoscience Australia</a> <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/07/22/australia_landsat_free_images_online/">recently announced</a> that it will license all images from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsat_program">Landsat 8 satellite</a> under <a href="/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>. (Geoscience Australia is a <a href="http://minister.ret.gov.au/MediaCentre/MediaReleases/Pages/AustraliaPartnershipSatelliteAccess.aspx">partner of the United States Geological Survey</a> in the Landsat program.)</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/weblog/entry/3705">Creative Commons Australia reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The new Landsat 8 satellite is scheduled to be launched in early 2013, with GAâ€™s full implementation being scheduled for May or June 2013.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Upon full implementation, which involves the deployment of major infrastructure upgrades by GA, data will be beamed from Landsat 8 on a daily basis to GA-operated ground stations in Alice Springs and Darwin. As soon as possible after receipt and processing, GA will make the satellite images publicly available free of charge.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>GA will make the data available under a <a href="/licenses/by/3.0/au/">Creative Commons CC BY Australia 3.0 licence</a>, which will facilitate legal reuse of the images.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>GA is expecting a major upsurge in demand for the images when its free to air service is up and running. Jeff Kingwell, Section Leader of GA&#8217;s National Earth Observation Group, has indicated this prediction is based on the experience of its senior partner Geological Survey where there was a 1000 fold usage increase on commencement of its free to air service online. &#8220;Our experience is that using the Creative Commons Attribution Licence&#160;&#8212; which is the default licence for GA information&#160;&#8212; makes the data more useful and easier to apply. For example, to help the Indonesian government to monitor forest management, GA supplies Landsat data from a number of foreign data archives. Since we can apply the same licence conditions to each data source, the information is much more useful and easier to share and reuse.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Here at Creative Commons, we applaud <a href="/government">governments and intergovernmental organizations licensing their information and data</a> under CC licenses (or the <a href="/about/cc0">CC0 public domain waiver</a>). Australia&#8217;s partnership with the United States in the Landsat program is a perfect example of why it&#8217;s important to use a license that&#8217;s open and internationally applicable.</p>
