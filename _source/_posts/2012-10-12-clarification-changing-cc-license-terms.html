<p>Here at Creative Commons, we sometimes get questions about whether it's possible for a licensor to change, clarify, or waive terms of our licenses. These questions can sometimes lead to conundra, but they also get to the heart of what Creative Commons licenses are all about. While we haven't changed our policies, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Can_I_change_the_license_terms_or_conditions.3F">we have added some new clarifications to our FAQ page</a> to help both licensors and licensees navigate these complicated issues.</p>
<h2>Do Your Clarifications Compromise the License?</h2>
<div style="float:left;padding:10px" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" about="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nics_events/2349630839"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nics_events/2349630839"><img width="240" height="159" src="img/2349630839_894519ed95_m.jpg" alt="Editing a paper" /></a>

<p>Can you add additional requirements for licensors? How about giving additional privileges, beyond those implied by the license deed? It comes down to a question of whether the consistency of the license itself is compromised.</p>
<p>Let's say you wanted to share your work under the terms of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY license</a>, but only with people named Jerry. Jerries would be welcome to share and remix your work as outlined in the terms of the license, while everyone else would have to ask you for permission. This very odd modification would contradict the terms of the license itself, which grant reuse rights to everyone; therefore, it's not an appropriate application of the CC license.</p>
<p>On the other hand, what if you wanted to grant certain licensees <em>additional reuse rights</em> beyond those granted in the license? That modification doesn't compromise the license itself; in fact, it's even facilitated by the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCPlus">CC+ protocol</a>.</p>
<p>For a much more thorough discussion of what modifications are and aren't consistent with CC licenses, see our new wiki page on <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Modifying_the_CC_licenses">modifying the CC licenses</a>.</p>
<h2>Can You Create Your Own License Based on CC? (Should You?)</h2></p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/policies">CC has never asserted copyright in the text of its licenses</a>. Effective immediately, we're making that policy explicit by dedicating the license text to the public domain under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0 public domain waiver</a>. We only ask that any adapted licenses not be identified with the names "Creative Commons," "CC," the CC logo, or any other trademarks associated with CC.</p>
<p>The more interesting question is whether you <em>should</em> create your own license based on CC. After all, one of the most compelling benefits of licensing your works under CC is that they can be combined, collected, and remixed with millions of other CC-licensed works. While we're not suggesting that CC licenses are appropriate for every possible use case, it's worth considering whether an adapted license is more beneficial to your licensees than a well understood one with a long history and large user base.</p>
